Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing regions are moving toward cloud computing to reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, many lack the skills and resources to deploy and secure these systems properly. Existing international frameworks such as NIST and ISO standards offer strong guidance but are often too complex or expensive for smaller organizations. 

This thesis aims to develop a practical and affordable \textit{Secure Cloud Deployment Framework} (SCDF) designed for SMEs in developing regions. The proposed framework combines essential cloud security principles with open-source tools that can be implemented step by step. The study will review related research, analyze regional challenges, and test the framework through simulations and case studies. 

The expected outcome is a simplified, cost-effective model that helps SMEs improve cloud security while supporting digital growth and resilience.
