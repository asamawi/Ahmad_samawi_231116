\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Context:} SMEs in developing regions adopting cloud computing for cost reduction and operational efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Problem:} Security risks arising from limited technical expertise, budget constraints, and weak infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Gap:} Existing standards (NIST, ISO) are too complex and expensive for smaller enterprises.
    \item \textbf{Proposed Solution:} A Secure Cloud Deployment Framework (SCDF) tailored for SMEs.
    \item \textbf{Approach:} Translates high-level security principles into practical, step-by-step, open-source based actions.
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} A deployable, cost-effective model validated through simulations and case studies to support resilient digital transformation.
