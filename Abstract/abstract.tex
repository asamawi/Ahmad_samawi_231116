Cloud computing promises to democratize enterprise-grade technology for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Yet for many, particularly in developing regions, this promise remains unfulfilled. Adoption is often stalled by a convergence of barriers: acute security fears, scarce technical skills, and rigid financial constraints. Furthermore, the global standards meant to guide secure adoption are frequently engineered for organizations with vastly more resources, leaving SMEs with requirements they cannot meet.

This thesis introduces the Secure Cloud Deployment Framework (SCDF) to close this capability gap. Moving beyond theoretical models, the SCDF translates high-level security principles into a pragmatic, risk-driven roadmap tailored for resource-constrained environments. It prioritizes high-impact controls, leverages automation to compensate for limited expertise, and utilizes open-source tooling to ensure cost viability.

Evaluated through simulations and case studies, the framework demonstrates that robust security does not require enterprise-level budgets. Results indicate that an incremental, automated approach significantly improves security posture and operational resilience. This study thus offers a validated path for sustainable digital transformation, proving that secure cloud adoption is achievable even in the most challenging contexts.
