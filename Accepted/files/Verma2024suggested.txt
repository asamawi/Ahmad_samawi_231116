    Furthermore, the study suggests creating a secure
authentication architecture to serve as the foundation for
implementing an innovative MFA system customized to
SMEs working in cloud settings. Table 2 summarizes the
findings from an exhaustive review of the literature on
security MFA aspects. The very first findings emphasize
essential components of identification including device based
and system integration aspects.
    The report also contains findings from early consultations
with industry experts and SMEs to assess[15] their
preparedness to implement such authentication techniques.
The interview findings will assist in determining the most
effective authentication aspects for a proof of concept (POC),
as well as recommending the integration of different security
methods to improve connection security while successfully
resolving privacy and confidentiality issues.
    As previously said, this study examined several security
measures to protect certain places. It also compares the                             Fig. 1. Architecture of Methodological Approach of Proposed MFA
