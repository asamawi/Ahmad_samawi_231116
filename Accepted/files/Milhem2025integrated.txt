                                                        From the perspective of global business trends, adopting efficient technologies has
                                                    become a crucial concern in human resource management (HRM; Klumb et al., 2024),
                                                    especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries.
                                                        Generally, HRM significantly impacts organizational performance regarding employee
                                                    relations, training, performance appraisal, and welfare (Zebari et al., 2019; Naji et al., 2022).
                                                    However, a literature gap exists on adopting cloud computing in SMEs’ HRM practices in
                                                    developing economies (Abdullah, I. et al., 2020; Al-Mutawa and Saeed Al Mubarak, 2024).
