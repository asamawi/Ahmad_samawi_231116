  Faculty of Economics              The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) in small-
and Business, Jenderal              and medium-sized firms (SMEs) is steadily increasing. However, the implementation

                                    knowledge, and reluctance to change. The objective of this study is to identify and ana-
                                    lyze prevalent patterns, obstacles and influences that impact the adoption of ICT
                                    in SMEs in developing nations. In addition, this study aims to provide recommenda-
                                    tions on the most effective methods to optimize the utilization of ICT in these contexts.
                                    This review is conducted using a sample of 25 publications that have been published
                                    and are available in the Scopus database. The selection process focuses on works
                                    that have received significant citations and have been published between 2014
                                    and 2023. The PRISMA statement form was utilized to elucidate the comprehensive
                                    procedure of selecting and accepting pertinent publications. This research makes
                                    two distinct contributions. The writers begin by doing a thorough literature analysis
                                    to examine the progress of ICT in the past decade. They next emphasize noteworthy
                                    research discoveries in this field. Furthermore, the authors give a comprehensive analy-
                                    sis of the ICT literature by quantifying yearly publications and identifying SMEs that pri-
                                    marily utilize ICT, academic journals that publish pertinent articles, and ICT-related
                                    publications across various fields and areas in developing nations. The study also dis-
                                    closes the papers, journals, and authors that have received the highest number of cita-
                                    tions. The author’s final argument in the paper is that, despite the extensive research
                                    conducted in the field of ICT, there is a necessity to customize strategies and policies
                                    that can support SMEs in the ICT sector, particularly in developing countries.

                                  Introduction
                                  Small businesses are beginning to realize the importance of computer systems in improv-
                                  ing their operations and performance (Mishrif & Khan, 2023). Information and com-
                                  munication technology (ICT) plays a crucial role in the corporate environment, serving
                                  not only as a tool for automation and cost reduction but also as a strategic driver that
                                  has the potential to radically alter the dynamics of competitiveness (Porter, 2001). ICT
                                  is recognized as providing small businesses with the potential for rapid access to global
                                  markets and customers, which can significantly increase their reach and competitiveness

                  (MacGregor & Vrazalic, 2005). ICTs used by SMEs include e-commerce (Braun, 2002),
                  websites (Ritchie & Brindley, 2005), digital payment (Kaynak et al., 2005), enterprise
                  resource planning (Olsen & Saetre, 2007b), mobile phone (Rabayah & Qalalwi, 2011),
                  social media (Michaelidou et al., 2011), cloud computing (Sultan, 2011), blockchain and
                  AI tools (Mishrif & Khan, 2023). The application of ICT, primarily e-commerce, pro-
                  vides ease of purchase, reduced costs, and faster response, can expand market reach
                  and increase the competitiveness of SMEs both locally and internationally (Indrayanto
                  et al., 2024; Lane et al., 2004). Merging data between departments with ERP systems for
                  SMEs can improve information accessibility, and better decision making and more effi-
                  cient operations (Olsen & Sætre, 2007a). Websites for SMEs are useful for reaching new
                  customers and increasing sales (Burke, 2009). Moreover, a more substantial online pres-
                  ence is needed to compete in the digital marketplace (Tan et al., 2009). Customers gen-
                  erally prefer online shopping to speed up shopping activities, assist in decision-making,
                  save money, and simplify the shopping process (Novandari et al., 2021). Social media
                  for SMEs are helpful in improving brand reputation, maintaining trust with customers,
                  and reducing the cost of digital advertising and promotion (Durkin et al., 2013; Sulasih
                  et al., 2023). The benefits of mobile phones for SMEs include more efficient data capture,
                  better communication, increased staff engagement, and the potential for advanced data
                  analysis and system integration (Bankosz & Kerins, 2014). Digital payments for SMEs
                  can streamline the transaction process, making it easier for customers to complete pur-
                  chases (Küster et al., 2016). Blockchain and AI optimize marketing operations and pro-
                  mote a more agile and data-centric marketing strategy, eventually enhancing consumer
                  pleasure and loyalty (Khan et al., 2023). Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
                  with proficient information and communication technology (ICT) skills and strong IT
                  capabilities generally achieve better financial performance and cost efficiency compared
                  to other companies, as indicated by Elbeltagi et al. (2013).
                    Previous studies on Information and Communication Technology have primarily
                  focused on large and multinational firms (Barua et al., 2004; Bharadwaj, 2000; Bryn-
                  jolfsson & Hitt, 2020; Liang et al., 2007; Mithas et al., 2011) compared to SMEs (Chen
                  et al., 2002; Cragg & King, 1993). Currently, the attention has turned towards small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as indicated by the works of (Arendt, 2008; Chege
                  et al., 2020; Marcelino-Sádaba et al., 2014; Müller et al., 2018; Wielicki & Arendt, 2010).
                  The development of skills and attitudes, including the ability of SMEs to recognize and
                  respond to value-creation opportunities, is critical for SMEs to leverage technology bet-
                  ter (Cunningham et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the existing body of evidence regarding the
                  factors that promote or impede the adoption of information and communication tech-
                  nology by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly in developing nations,
                  remains scarce (Kurnia et al., 2015).
                    Empirical studies that mention how to implement information and communication
                  technology in SMEs in developing countries are still few (Kurnia et al., 2015; Mapes-
                  hoane & Pather, 2016). Prior systematic reviews and bibliometric analyses predomi-
                  nantly utilized data sourced from the Web of Science (Dabi et al., 2020; D’Angelo &
                  Belvedere, 2023; Tubis & Grzybowska, 2022; Yogarajan et al., 2023). This research is
                  distinctive, because it utilizes data from the Scopus database, which is recognized as
                  the largest peer-reviewed literature database encompassing a broad spectrum of global
Yuwono et al. Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship   (2024) 13:31                                         Page 3 of 23




                  and regional journals, conference proceedings, and books (Baas et al., 2020; Cordes &
                  Marinova, 2023). It is argued that SMEs in developing countries face various technical
                  capability constraints when applying information and communication technology (ICT)
                  for business growth and competitiveness. SMEs in developing countries exhibit less
                  enthusiasm for implementing ICT compared to large companies due to financial limita-
                  tions and organizational and managerial preparedness (Shahadat et al., 2023). Therefore,
                  it is necessary to examine the factors contributing to the disparity in the adoption of ICT
                  practices in small firms, specifically in SMEs of developing countries. Hence, the objec-
                  tive of this study is to examine the existing literature on information and communication
                  technology (ICT) in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and analyze the pat-
                  terns and themes in ICT research by addressing the following research inquiries.
                     RQ 1. How has ICT evolved over the years?
                     RQ 2. What are the main research streams and focus areas in the ICT literature?
                     RQ 3. What internal and external factors influence ICT adoption in SMEs of develop-
                  ing countries?
                     RQ 4. What are the barriers and outcomes of ICT implementation in developing coun-
                  try SMEs?

                  Definition and importance of SMEs
                  SMEs in developing countries play a crucial role in economic development, employ-
                  ment, and innovation. The precise parameters that define small- and medium-sized
                  enterprises (SMEs), such as the number of employees, yearly turnover, and investment
                  amount, can vary considerably across different countries. The various interpretations
                  of this concept highlight the tailored strategies implemented by nations to assist small-
                  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) based on their distinct economic environments
                  and governmental goals. In India, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are classified
                  according to their capital expenditure on equipment and machinery. Micro-enterprises
                  are businesses with a capital investment of up to INR 2.5 million (Kumar et al., 2017). In
                  Bangladesh, SMEs are classified as firms with fewer than 100 employees (Azam, 2015).
                  In Malaysia, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are classified according to
                  their staff count and yearly revenue. Small firms typically have a workforce of 5 to 75
                  individuals and generate annual revenues ranging from RM300,000 to RM5 million. On
                  the other hand, medium enterprises employ 75–200 people and have an annual turnover
                  between RM5 million and RM50 million (Ibrahim et al., 2018).
                    Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are crucial for the economic progress
                  of emerging nations, making substantial contributions to the gross domestic prod-
                  uct (GDP), employment rates, and exports. SMEs in Bangladesh contribute approxi-
                  mately 45% of the manufacturing value added, almost 80% of industrial employment,
                  and between 75% and 80% of export earnings. In addition, the agricultural industry
                  contributes approximately 44% of employment in the country, highlighting its signifi-
                  cant importance in job generation and economic growth. SMEs in Bangladesh are esti-
                  mated to account for approximately 20–25% of the country’s GDP (Azam, 2015). On a
                  global scale, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are acknowledged for their
                  significant role in fostering economic growth and generating employment opportunities.
                  SMEs in Singapore account for 46% of the country’s GDP and 63% of its employment.
Yuwono et al. Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship   (2024) 13:31                                              Page 4 of 23




                  In European countries, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) contribute approx-
                  imately 60 to 70% of the total employment. In Japan, this percentage is much higher,
                  surpassing 78%. SMEs in Pakistan make up around 40% of the annual GDP, 25% of
                  industrial exports, and 78% of individual employment (Pathan et al., 2017). These con-
                  tributions demonstrate the crucial significance of SMEs in stimulating economic expan-
                  sion, enhancing job prospects, and elevating living standards, thereby establishing them
                  as the fundamental pillar of the economy (Heim et al., 2019).

                  ICT and its relevance to SMEs
                  Information and communication technology (ICT) refers to various technologies that
                  collect, manipulate, retain, and distribute information. It encompasses technologies
                  such as the internet, telecommunications (mobile phones and landlines), wireless net-
                  works, digital broadcasting, and other digital technologies that transmit and manipulate
                  information in different formats. Information and communication technology (ICT) is
                  fundamental to contemporary existence. It has become an essential element of company
                  operations, facilitating organizations to function more efficiently, expand into new mar-
                  kets, and enhance communication and information exchange (Kossaï & Piget, 2014).
                     Regarding small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is essential to consider the
                  significance of information and communication technology (ICT). It provides excep-
                  tional prospects for firms to raise operational efficiency, elevate customer service, and
                  foster product and service delivery innovation. The adoption and utilization of ICT by
                  SMEs play a crucial role in enhancing their performance and competitiveness, particu-
                  larly in a globalized economy, where market success is often contingent upon techno-
                  logical competence (Azam, 2015). Information and communication technology (ICT)
                  allows small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to optimize their operations,
                  decrease expenses, and enhance their ability to adapt to market fluctuations. In addition,
                  it empowers them to engage in competition at a broader scope, accessing untapped mar-
                  kets and clientele via e-commerce and online advertising.
                     The utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) in small and
                  medium enterprises (SMEs) is of utmost importance for advancing the economy in
                  emerging nations. A study conducted on Tunisian SMEs in the electrical and electronics
                  industry has demonstrated that effectively implementing ICT can substantially impact
                  firm profitability. The study found a favorable correlation between the extent of ICT uti-
                  lization and firm performance (Kossaï & Piget, 2014). Moreover, implementing infor-
                  mation and communication technology (ICT) in small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
                  can foster creativity, stimulate expansion, and empower small enterprises to compete
                  with greater efficiency on both domestic and global scales. Nevertheless, despite the
                  potential advantages, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) require assistance in
                  embracing information and communication technology (ICT), which involves overcom-
                  ing internal and external obstacles. It is crucial to tackle these difficulties to fully use the
                  advantages of ICT for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), enhance their role
                  in economic development, and guarantee their long-term growth and competitiveness
                  in the global market (Vidhyalakshmi & Kumar, 2016).
                     Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) require assistance in embracing infor-
                  mation and communication technology (ICT) due to the rapid digitalization prompted

                  by the COVID-19 pandemic. This shift has exacerbated the disparity between large
                  and small firms. However, large corporations have successfully utilized omnichannel
                  strategies and captured a substantial share of consumer demand during limited social
                  mobility. On average, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have yet to tap into
                  internet commerce’s complete benefits fully. This disparity highlights a digital econ-
                  omy dichotomy wherein tiny enterprises face challenges in competing with their larger
                  counterparts in the digital realm. Furthermore, the intrinsic constraints of small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), such as their incapacity to benefit from economies of
                  scale and to innovate with cutting-edge technologies, worsen their challenges in adopt-
                  ing information and communication technology (ICT). These constraints impede their
                  ability to compete globally and restrict them to catering to domestic consumers (Mer-
                  amveliotakis & Manioudis, 2021).


                  Methodology
                  The primary aim of this study is to investigate the influence of information and com-
                  munication technology on small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs) in developing nations
                  (Paprotny, 2021). This study has undertaken a systematic literature review (SLR) of prior
                  research on information and communication technology (ICT) in small- and medium-
                  sized enterprises (SMEs). A systematic literature review (SLR) seeks to resolve concerns
                  in the current body of research by finding, critically assessing, and incorporating all per-
                  tinent studies conducted within a specific topic while also addressing one or more spe-
                  cific studies. Systematic literature review (SLR) distinguishes itself from typical literature
                  reviews by placing a strong emphasis on transparency, evidence, impact, validity, and
                  causality.
                    This approach ensures the robustness of the evidence gathered (Mohamed Shaffril
                  et al., 2021). The PRISMA statement form is utilized to delineate the comprehensive
                  procedure of selecting and excluding pertinent papers in systematic reviews and meta-
                  analyses. The PRISMA statements aid researchers in enhancing the documentation of
                  systematic literature review publications (Page et al., 2021). The review was conducted
                  using research publications published in the SCOPUS database from 2014 to 2023 as the
                  basis.
                    Literature search. A search for relevant publications was conducted on February 26,
                  2024, using the Scopus database. The search was performed using the search terms
                  "ICT*" and "SME*." The search produced a total of 1081 articles from 2014 to 2023,
                  covering 10 years. Given the significant increase in publications over the past dec-
                  ade, we have chosen this time to perform a systematic review on the implementation
                  of information and communication technology (ICT) in small and medium enterprises
                  (SMEs), despite its initial introduction in 1999 by Premkumar and Roberts. Following
                  the curation of papers published between 2014 and 2023 in the domain of business and
                  management, a total of 380 articles were retained. Given the focus of our research on
                  business and management, we have disregarded articles that were published in other
                  subject areas. There were 251 documents left after choosing the document type "Arti-
                  cles." Upon choosing the publication stage and picking articles written in the "English"
                  language, a total of 239 articles were extracted. To enhance the reliability of the analysis
                  while upholding quality criteria, this study specifically chose articles that had 20 or more

                  citations. Subsequently, a total of 73 papers were selected for the study based on their
                  citation count of 20 or above. After eliminating unnecessary papers, the total number of
                  surviving papers was 25. Figure 1 provides a concise overview of the process of including
                  and excluding certain elements.
                     Quality assessment The selected papers underwent a thorough and rigorous screening
                  procedure to incorporate the most outstanding research in the study. Only papers with
                  a high number of citations (more than 20) were chosen to uphold standards of research
                  quality and enhance comprehension of topics. Paper duplication was rigorously man-
                  aged during the selection process.
                     Criteria for eligibility and inclusion This review paper is derived from the original pub-
                  lished article. The study eliminated conference papers to uphold quality requirements.
                  The researchers focused exclusively on examining ICT business and management view-
                  points, excluding all other sectors from their study. The database Scopus was selected
                  for article search because of its extensive collection of publications in the discipline, sur-
                  passing other databases such as Web of Science (Cordes & Marinova, 2023). Due to the
                  predominance of English in the field of ICT literature, only articles written in English
                  were chosen. An additional rationale for exclusively choosing papers written in English
                  is its global comprehensibility and widespread acceptance. This study included both

                     The study used a qualitative synthesis For this study, a total of 25 publications pub-
                  lished in Scopus-indexed journals between 2014 and 2023 were chosen for examination.
                  Following the selection of the papers, the procedure proceeded with two consecutive
                  steps. The initial phase involved exporting relevant metadata from Scopus to Microsoft
                  Excel to facilitate a descriptive study of the literature. This analysis focused on the distri-
                  bution of publications by year and field and the application of ICT in developing nations
                  to enhance competitiveness in SMEs.
                     An analysis was undertaken to observe the number of publications and publication
                  trends during the past decade, focusing on a year-by-year basis. A sector study was
                  undertaken to identify industries within small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
                  that are adopting information and communication technology (ICT). This systematic
                  review also highlighted the internal and external elements of ICT adoption that can
                  enhance the competitiveness of SMEs. These factors are illustrated in Fig. 2.

                  Analytical framework
                  In the growing area of information and communication technology (ICT) in small and
                  medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing nations, it is crucial to identify and address
                  internal and external obstacles to achieve sustainable growth and maintain competitive-
                  ness. Based on a thorough analysis of 25 studies, a valuable analytical framework has
                  evolved to guide future research efforts.

                    The framework illuminates the intricate interrelationships among different obstacles
                  and offers strategic avenues for successful resolution. As researchers delve into further
                  investigations in the field of ICT in SMEs in developing countries, this fundamental
                  framework acts as a guide, enabling a more profound comprehension of the obstacles
                  and possibilities, ultimately leading to transformative advancements in theory and prac-
                  tice. Figure 3 provides additional information on the analytical framework.

                  25 examined publications, only 18 explicitly referred to a theoretical framework, while
                  the remaining articles discussed notions based on previous research. The subsequent
                  passage delineates the theoretical frameworks employed in the study conducted thus far.
                    IT does not matter questions the conventional belief that technological innovation is
                  the main factor for gaining a competitive edge. Instead, it promotes prioritizing resource
                  optimization and strategic organizational value. According to this idea, small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should shift their approach from making significant
                  investments in Information Technology infrastructure to maximizing the use of their
                  current resources and adopting information and communication technology (ICT) ser-
                  vices that fulfil particular and basic needs, without putting a considerable strain on capi-
                  tal expenses (Soon et al., 2015).
                    Mirkovski et al. (2016) employ a combination of Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)
                  and Social Exchange Theory (SET) to analyze the impact of environmental uncertainty
                  on contractual and relational governance in ICT-based supply chain practices, spe-
                  cifically information sharing and collaboration. According to these ideas, small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should enhance their contractual and relational pro-
                  cedures to understand better the intricacies of adopting information and communica-
                  tion technology (ICT). This understanding would enable them to effectively incorporate
                  ICT into their supply chains, particularly while dealing with uncertain environmental
                  conditions.
                    The intellectual capital view (ICV) posits that some elements of intellectual capital,
                  mainly ICT capital generated on a global scale, play a crucial role in attaining more
                  significant levels of product innovation through worldwide expansion. This viewpoint
                  implies that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) must build and utilize infor-
                  mation and communication technology (ICT) skills focused on global operations. This
                  will enable them to create new and innovative goods and effectively enter new markets.
                  The approach emphasizes the significance of ICT as a tool for improving operational
                  efficiency and as a valuable asset that may aid in developing new goods and gaining a
                  competitive edge in global marketplaces (Molodchik & Jardon, 2017).
                    According to organisational improvisation theory, small- and medium-sized enter-
                  prises (SMEs) can gain advantages by embracing an improvisational mindset. This mind-
                  set involves being receptive to exploring new technologies, being flexible in changing,
                  and making prompt decisions in response to unforeseen challenges or opportunities in
                  information and communication technology (Valaei et al., 2017).
                    The technology–organisation–environment (TOE) frameworks and diffusion of
                  innovations (DOI) theories provide a thorough examination of the elements that
                  impact the adoption of technology by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
                  taking into account both internal and external factors that influence this decision. The
                  TOE theory offers a framework for analyzing the technological, organizational, and
                  environmental environments in which small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
                  function. According to the TOE framework, small- and medium-sized enterprises
                  (SMEs) must carefully evaluate their technology requirements and capabilities, utilize
                  their organizational strengths and adaptability, and stay informed about external fac-
                  tors such as government policies and market demands. This will enable them to adopt

                  and gain advantages from information and communication technology (Gono et al.,
                  2016; Pathan et al., 2017; Sivathanu, 2019).
                    The DOI theory facilitates comprehension of the diffusion of new technologies
                  within an organization. The theoretical framework promotes the adoption of infor-
                  mation and communication technology (ICT) by small- and medium-sized enter-
                  prises (SMEs) to enhance their success and competitiveness (Kossaï & Piget, 2014).
                  SMEs should comprehensively evaluate their preparedness and possible advantages of
                  adopting technology based on integrating TOE and DOI theories (Dincă et al., 2019;
                  Kumar et al., 2017).
                    Mirkovski et al. (2019) employed Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Social
                  Exchange Theory (SET) to investigate the interactions of information and commu-
                  nication technology (ICT) in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within
                  supply chains in developing nations. The field of Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)
                  examines the expenses linked to transactions and their impact on the behaviour and
                  structure of organizations. TCE suggests that enterprises should reduce these costs
                  to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. SET underscores the significance of social
                  connections and trust in facilitating transactions, indicating that small- and medium-
                  sized enterprises (SMEs) should prioritize establishing and upkeep robust interper-
                  sonal ties to improve information sharing and collaboration.
                    Value co-creation is based on the assumption that information and communication
                  technology (ICT) enables value production. This enables companies at various stages
                  of ICT implementation to collaborate and enhance their business processes, ulti-
                  mately leading to improved organizational performance. Small- and medium-sized
                  enterprises (SMEs) are advised to embrace information and communication technol-
                  ogy (ICT) to enhance their internal operations and collaborate with other companies
                  to generate value. This includes partnering with firms with higher ICT utilization
                  (Heim et al., 2019).
                    Knowledge management (KM) is based on the belief that SMEs may improve their
                  innovation skills and competitive advantage by successfully developing, sharing, and
                  capitalizing on knowledge within and across organizational boundaries. According to
                  this theory, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should actively participate
                  in knowledge management practices. This involves promoting a culture of sharing
                  knowledge, investing in information and communication technology (ICT) to facili-
                  tate knowledge sharing, and establishing strong connections with external partners to
                  access and incorporate a wide range of knowledge into the SME’s innovation process
                  (Ben Arfi & Hikkerova, 2021).
                    Azam (2015) employed various theoretical frameworks, including the Diffusion of
                  Innovations (DOI) Theory, Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) Frame-
                  work, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), The-
                  ory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), Institutional Theory, Unified Theory of Acceptance
                  and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and Resource-based View (RBV), to investigate the
                  factors that affect the adoption of information and communication technology (ICT)
                  by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the impact of this adoption on
                  SME performance. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) posits that the percep-
                  tion of how easy and beneficial a technology is crucial in determining its acceptance
Yuwono et al. Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship   (2024) 13:31                                                                Page 11 of 23




                  and usage behaviour. This implies that if small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
                  view information and communication technology (ICT) as valuable and user-friendly,
                  they are more inclined to embrace and incorporate it into their business activities.
                    The TRA (Theory of Reasoned Action) and TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) posit
                  that an individual’s inclination to engage in a particular behaviour, such as ICT adop-
                  tion, is shaped by their attitude towards the behaviour and subjective norms. The TPB
                  further includes perceived behavioural control as a determinant, indicating that inter-
                  nal and external perceptions play a role in an SME’s decision to adopt ICT. Institu-
                  tional Theory posits that the adoption of information and communication technology
                  (ICT) by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is impacted by external influences and
                  the need to conform to industry and societal norms and expectations. This implies
                  that factors beyond the immediate perceived benefits may drive the adoption of ICT.
                    The UTAUT model proposes that the anticipation of good performance, the expec-
                  tation of effort, social influence, and favourable conditions predict the adoption and
                  utilization of technology. According to this theory, small- and medium-sized enter-
                  prises (SMEs) should enhance these four characteristics to enhance the probability
                  of successfully adopting information and communication technology (ICT) in their
                  organizations (Ibrahim et al., 2018). The resource-based view (RBV) theory posits
                  that organizations achieve long-term competitive advantage by holding resources and
                  talents that are valued, scarce, difficult to imitate, and cannot be easily replaced. ICT
                  resources and competencies can provide SMEs with a competitive edge in terms of
                  innovation and competition (Amoako et al., 2022; Aslesen & Harirchi, 2015; Golonka,
                  2015) (Table 1).

                  Descriptive analysis
                  This section will analyze the descriptive statistics of the papers chosen throughout the
                  review process. It will examine factors such as the year of publication, industry focus,
                  number of citations, journal of publication, and research methodology employed in
                  the selected studies.
                    By year, Fig. 4 illustrates the trajectory of ICT use among small- and medium-sized
                  enterprises (SMEs) from 2014 to 2023. The data are derived from the annual publica-
                  tion count but are restricted to research that has received significant citations. 2019
                  and 2017 were the years with the highest number of papers that received high-cita-
                  tion reports, defined as having more than 20 citations.
                    Industry base. The results of industries that utilize ICT are depicted in Fig. 5. Indus-
                  tries are primarily categorized into four sectors: agriculture, mining, manufacturing
                  (including electrical industry, electronics, apparel, food, drinks, etc.), and services
                  (such as marketing and software-based small and medium enterprises). Several arti-
                  cles included small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their analysis, whereas
                  the remaining articles did not specify the industries that were included in the study.
                  They have been classified inside the "other" classification. Out of the chosen research,
                  5 studies either encompassed all small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or did
                  not specify which SMEs were examined. The fraction of small- and medium-sized
                  enterprises (SMEs) that implemented information and communication technology
                  (ICT) was primarily focused on researching manufacturing. The total number of stud-
                  ies discovered was 11, as determined from the selected papers. Based on the graph
                  shown (Fig. 5), it can be deduced that the adoption of ICT is more prevalent among
                  small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing and services sectors, as
                  opposed to those in the agriculture and mining sectors.

                     Journal base. The "International Journal of Business Information Systems" has had the
                  highest number of publications in the past 10 years, with a total of three articles pub-
                  lished between 2014 and 2023. Subsequently, additional magazines published a single
                  article each. Table 2 displays the leading journals and the papers that were published
                  during the specified time frame.
                     Regional distribution. An intriguing discovery from this analysis is the dispersion of
                  ICT studies among various locations in poor countries (Paprotny, 2021). Figure 6 dem-
                  onstrates that the majority of studies were carried out in India and Malaysia. More
                  research needs to be undertaken in other emerging nations. More studies and imple-
                  mentation of ICT in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing coun-
                  tries worldwide need to be conducted. Our findings align with Aslesen and Harirchi
                  (2015) assertion that India is the primary source of scholarly research on ICT in devel-
                  oping nations, as depicted in Fig. 6.
                     According to the citations. The minimum threshold for paper selection in this review
                  was set at 20 citations per paper. The article authored by Puthusserry et al. (2020)
                  received the highest number of citations among the articles in the selected column, with
                  a total of 53 citations. Table 3 presents a concise overview of the 10 papers that have
                  received the highest number of citations, including information about the authors and
                  the year in which they were published.



                  Classification
                  To ascertain the specific areas of research concentration in the existing literature, we
                  have established four distinct research streams. This section aims to categorize the lit-
                  erature and provide an overview of the main areas of research in information and com-
                  munication technology (ICT) in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

                    Topic 2: Influence of internal and external factors on the use of information and com-
                  munication technology in small- and medium-sized businesses. The internal factors
                  that influence the adoption and effective use of ICT by SMEs are crucial, as they have a
                  direct impact on the performance, competitiveness, and innovation capabilities of SMEs
                  (Rozak et al., 2023). ICT adoption enables small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
                  to enhance their competitiveness on a global level by improving efficiency and fostering
                  stronger ties with customers and suppliers (Vidhyalakshmi & Kumar, 2016).
                    The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) in small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to enhance their competitiveness is greatly influenced
                  by the managerial qualities of both the firms and the managers. Managers who have a
                  forward-looking approach and are receptive to technological advances are more likely
                  to realize the value of ICT investments in streamlining operations, increasing produc-
                  tivity, and opening up new market opportunities (Kossaï & Piget, 2014). The owner’s
                  receptiveness to technology and the firm’s preparedness to innovate determine its will-
                  ingness to implement ICT. At the same time, the costs associated with installation and

                  implementation are essential barriers that depend on the financial health and operating
                  budget of the SME. In addition, the anticipated return on investment from ICT deploy-
                  ment is also essential, as SMEs need to ensure that the financial benefits justify the initial
                  and ongoing investment (Vidhyalakshmi & Kumar, 2016).
                    Kumar et al. (2017) contend that the support and commitment of senior management
                  are crucial for the successful implementation and integration of information and com-
                  munication technology (ICT) in organizational operations. Their leadership is vital in
                  overcoming resistance to change, ensuring that the potential of ICT is fully utilized to
                  achieve business objectives and drive growth, thus positioning SMEs to gain a competi-
                  tive advantage in an increasingly digital business environment.
                    Results Gono et al. (2016) support the notion that the size and age of a company, along
                  with its experience in using information and communication technology (ICT), have a
                  significant impact on the adoption of ICT to enhance the competitiveness of small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Firm age indicates stability, which is associated with
                  market knowledge and resource advantages, thus facilitating ICT adoption. Large firms
                  with more employees and multiple branches tend to have better financial and human
                  resources, enabling them to invest in and implement ICT solutions more effectively. This
                  organizational capacity not only facilitates technology but also positions SMEs to make
                  better use of ICT. (Ibrahim et al., 2018).
                    The implementation of organizational strategies, such as the formation of diverse
                  partnerships, plays a vital role in leveraging ICT to improve SME competitiveness. Such
                  strategies enable SMEs to access a broader range of resources, knowledge and technol-
                  ogy (Golonka, 2015). Research Rozak et al. (2023) stated that the enhancement of digital
                  skills among SME members, including staff, managers, leaders, and owners, significantly
                  improved their experience with ICT, fostering a commitment to its increased use for
                  continuous improvement, which is critical to improving the competitiveness of SMEs.
                    Based on the research findings of Molodchik and Jardon (2017), SMEs that invest in
                  research and development (R&D) are better positioned to utilize ICT to improve their
                  competitiveness. The application of cloud computing in research (Soon et al., 2015)
                  allows SMEs to focus on their core competencies by leveraging shared services, thus
                  eliminating traditional resource limitations and underutilized data center issues. This
                  shift optimizes the use of technology and simplifies business processes. The efficiencies
                  gained through these technology linkages are critical for SMEs to maintain sustainability
                  and competitiveness in an increasingly digitized and globalized business environment.
                    Valaei et al. (2017) asserted that exploratory learning strategies lay the foundation for
                  improvisational and compositional creativity, enabling organizations to strategize and
                  react dynamically to unpredictable market changes through insights, rapid experimenta-
                  tion, and evolutionary learning. This approach not only fosters an innovative culture but
                  also ensures that SMEs can utilize ICT effectively to maintain a competitive advantage in
                  a highly competitive market.
                    Zaidan (2017) highlighted the need for SMEs to improve human resource compe-
                  tencies by hiring and rewarding skilled and talented staff, thereby creating a pleasant
                  workplace. This strategy maintains crucial human capital and fosters the adoption and
                  innovative exploitation of information and communication technology. Moreover, as
                  stated by Ben Arfi and Hikkerova (2021), it is crucial to prioritize the establishment of
Yuwono et al. Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship   (2024) 13:31                                        Page 17 of 23




                  a culture that promotes innovation and the sharing of knowledge. The combination of
                  knowledge exchange and a culture that fosters innovation allows small- and medium-
                  sized enterprises (SMEs) to effectively leverage information and communication tech-
                  nology (ICT), resulting in enhanced competitiveness within their specific markets.
                    External factors impact the implementation of information and communication tech-
                  nology (ICT) in small- and medium-sized businesses. Due to global challenges arising
                  from technological breakthroughs and globalisation, SMEs are compelled to incorporate
                  information and communication technology (ICT) into their operations. In addition,
                  suppliers and consumers frequently demand online communication and transactions
                  from SMEs (Azam, 2015). This competitive pressure, according to Mirkovski et al.
                  (2016), requires SMEs to implement and utilize ICT as a strategic response to the com-
                  petitive dynamics in their industry. The application of ICT enables SMEs to improve
                  their operational efficiency and compete more effectively in the digital marketplace.
                    Research Soon et al. (2015) showed that economic turmoil and the evolution of digital
                  markets present challenges and opportunities for SMEs in implementing ICT. In peri-
                  ods of economic recession, small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs) may be more careful
                  when choosing information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, such
                  as cloud computing services. Although SMEs face several obstacles, the internet’s rapid
                  expansion and the rise of cloud services offer them the chance to leverage shared ser-
                  vices and concentrate on their core strengths. This, in turn, enhances their competitive-
                  ness in the digital market.
                    Amoako et al. (2022) suggested that SMEs utilize ICT tools such as electronic data
                  interchange, the Internet, and supplier quality management software to improve opera-
                  tions between external partners (customers and suppliers) to achieve cooperation among
                  supply chain partners, which in turn has a positive impact on performance. Small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have the opportunity to engage in partnerships with
                  industry associations to implement information and communication technology (ICT).
                  This collaboration enables SMEs to effectively and promptly respond to market dynam-
                  ics and meet the evolving demands of customers. Industry organizations provide small
                  and emerging businesses with a platform to receive assistance and knowledge through
                  workshops. The workshops encompass a broad spectrum of subjects, including intro-
                  ducing novel technology and products and providing market-specific knowledge. Indus-
                  try associations also offer informal mentoring opportunities where senior professionals
                  share their experiences, successes and failures (Puthusserry et al., 2020).
                    Technology collaboration and innovation strategies also play an essential role in
                  improving the competitiveness of SMEs through the application of ICT (Aslesen &
                  Harirchi, 2015). This strategy involves SMEs engaging in partnerships and networks with
                  external entities, such as other companies, universities, research institutes, non-govern-
                  mental organizations, and government agencies, to access diverse sources of knowledge
                  and innovative technologies (Aryanto et al., 2018).
                    According to JosephNg (2019), ICT consulting services are crucial for the successful
                  implementation and maintenance of ICT solutions. External consultancy can assist
                  small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs) in effectively managing the complexity of ICT
                  deployment. This ensures that their technology infrastructure is not only current but
                  also in line with their business goals, enabling them to grow and compete effectively
Yuwono et al. Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship   (2024) 13:31                                         Page 18 of 23




                  in the market. In line with this opinion, Sivathanu (2019) also mentioned that sup-
                  port from technology vendors is critical. This support can range from providing ICT
                  solutions tailored to the specific needs of SMEs to offering training and maintenance
                  services to ensure effective implementation and use of technology.
                    A crucial factor, according to Heim et al. (2019), is the presence of a clear legal and
                  regulatory framework that can address intellectual property rights, data protection,
                  and online transactions, ensure fair competition, and facilitate access to digital infra-
                  structure and services. Pathan et al. (2017); Dincă et al. (2019) also agree that gov-
                  ernment or regulatory support has a positive impact on ICT adoption among SMEs.
                  Especially in developing countries, where external environmental factors and govern-
                  ment support play an essential role in shaping the rules of ICT implementation for
                  SMEs operating in the region (Mirkovski et al., 2019).
                    Topic 3: Outcomes of ICT implementation. While ICT implementation is seen as
                  an essential factor for improving the competitiveness and operational efficiency of
                  SMEs, its actual contribution to enterprise performance depends on how well the
                  technology is integrated and leveraged in organizational processes. For SMEs to truly
                  benefit from ICT, there needs to be a focus not only on ICT deployment but also on
                  the strategic alignment of ICT with SME business processes and objectives (Azam,
                  2015).
                    ICT adoption in manufacturing SMEs improves operational efficiency and expan-
                  sion into new markets through strategic partnerships with large firms (Gono et al.,
                  2016). The utilization of ICT enables SMEs to achieve significant cost savings, main-
                  tain and enhance collaboration with business partners, manage external communi-
                  cation with stakeholders more effectively, and streamline transactions (Rozak et al.,
                  2023).
                    ICT, especially cloud computing, provides significant benefits to SMEs by offering
                  cost-effective ICT services that are highly favorable to new entrepreneurs. (Pathan
                  et al., 2017). The application of ICT to SMEs, particularly in the agricultural sector,
                  has been shown to significantly increase their productivity and contribute to a coun-
                  try’s Gross Domestic Product (Ibrahim et al., 2018).
                    SMEs categorized as using ICT moderately or intensively show a net profit margin
                  of more than 2% compared to companies that do not use ICT (Kossaï & Piget, 2014).
                  In line with that, Vidhyalakshmi and Kumar (2016) also concluded that the applica-
                  tion of ICT in SMEs has shown significant positive results, including increased global
                  market presence, increased agility, and increased profitability.
                    Topic 4. Barriers to ICT adoption. SMEs in developing countries that are already
                  large, with many branches and employees, are successfully applying ICT to improve
                  their competitiveness by increasing sales and marketing, streamlining operations,
                  efficiently managing remote branches and engaging in strategic collaboration. Never-
                  theless, this is a significant difficulty for small-scale SMEs, particularly those in their
                  nascent stages, since they encounter numerous constraints when it comes to utilizing
                  their resources. Researchers have found several significant obstacles to the use of ICT
                  in SMEs, which are outlined in Table 4.
                    The primary obstacles to the adoption of ICT are budgetary limitations, deficien-
                  cies in skills, inadequate utilization of ICT, characteristics of the organization and

                  its owner, government assistance, and insufficient awareness and trust. Small- and
                  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) must comprehend these obstacles to devise effec-
                  tive ways to overcome them when employing ICT (Kossaï & Piget, 2014).
                    The need for more skilled personnel to implement and manage ICT solutions is a
                  significant obstacle for SMEs in developing countries. SMEs often need more financial
                  resources compared to large enterprises, making it difficult to invest in ICT (Vidhyalak-
                  shmi & Kumar, 2016).
                    The characteristics and attitudes of firms and their owners towards technology adop-
                  tion can significantly influence the extent of ICT implementation. SMEs led by owners
                  who do not prioritize ICT tend to underutilize ICT (Kossaï & Piget, 2014).
                    SMEs need to fully realize the benefits and potential of ICT in improving their busi-
                  ness operations and competitiveness. In addition, concerns over security and privacy
                  lead to a need for more trust in ICT solutions. Sivathanu (2019) suggested that the gov-
                  ernment should help in terms of incentives, subsidies, and policies that encourage ICT
                  adoption, as a lack of government support can be a significant obstacle to ICT adoption
                  by SMEs.


                  Conclusions and future directions
                  This study’s main objective is to thoroughly assess the current body of literature on
                  information and communication technology (ICT) and offer responses to the research
                  questions. This study focuses on the first research topic by providing a concise overview
                  of the current research on the pivotal role of Information and Communication Technol-
                  ogies (ICTs) in improving the competitiveness of small and medium companies (SMEs)
                  in developing economies. This is accomplished by employing descriptive statistics. The
                  current material was classified into four main categories to address the second research
                  question. The study has collated the 25 most cited publications on Information and
                  Communication Technology (ICT) in small and medium companies (SMEs) in develop-
                  ing countries published during the last decade. The researchers have compiled and con-
                  densed the essential findings they have produced. Overall, there is a need to enhance the
                  amount of ICT research conducted on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in devel-
                  oping nations that obtain more than 20 citations.
                     According to the descriptive statistics, India represents 20% of the highly referenced
                  ICT research on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. While
                  scholars from other developing countries also made contributions, it was primar-
                  ily Indian researchers who played a prominent role, highlighting a noticeable disparity

                  in ICT studies in other developing nations. Since ICT research is primarily conducted
                  in established SMEs, future studies must investigate using various ICT tools and plat-
                  forms to enhance diverse aspects of SME performance in developing nations. This study
                  should also focus on identifying the obstacles that arise and finding strategies to over-
                  come them.
                     The current research on information and communication technology (ICT) in small-
                  and medium-sized firms (SMEs) primarily focuses on SMEs in the manufacturing and
                  services sectors. Other related industries have gotten less attention in these studies.
                  Moreover, a cross-sectional design is predominantly employed in most research stud-
                  ies. Future longitudinal research has the potential to offer fresh insights into the unre-
                  solved process. Implementing policies for ICT operations in small- and medium-sized
                  firms (SMEs), especially in developing nations, is of utmost importance. Investigations
                  should highlight the impact of government intervention in promoting the adoption of
                  information and communication technology (ICT) to strengthen the competitiveness of
                  small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs). The study has identified intrinsic and extrinsic
                  factors that need to be addressed to promote the implementation of Information and
                  Communication Technology (ICT) in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in devel-
                  oping countries. The fourth study examines the limitations and outcomes of introduc-
                  ing information and communication technology (ICT) in small and medium enterprises
                  (SMEs) in developing nations.
