  ABSTRACT An increasingly important advancement in information and communication technologies is
  cloud computing, and a remarkably increasing trend is its adoption by various organizations. The trend is
  attributed to the potential of this growing computing paradigm to improve the scalability, efficiency, and
  reliability of IT systems. Diffusion of cloud computing innovation is changing the way business information
  systems are developed, paid for, and maintained Alshamaila et al. 2013, Low et al. 2011, thus contributing to
  efficiency and better value for enterprises. This not only applies to large organizations, but also progressively
  more to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, little is known about the factors most likely
  to be associated to the adoption behavior of cloud computing services among small and medium enterprises
  operating in Lebanon. This study deploys the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework and
  the Contextual Theory to empirically examine the determinants of cloud computing service adoption in
  a developing country, namely Lebanon. A model is proposed, and data collected from 139 respondents
  working in SMEs in Lebanon and analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and logistic regression in
  SPSS provide strong support for the model. Results indicate that technological (i.e., complexity and security)
  and organizational (i.e., top management support and prior IT experience) factors are positively related to
  the decision to adopt cloud computing services. Moreover, one of the areas of potential interest is the effect
  of country-specific, or contextual factors, among those who intend to adopt cloud computing. The analysis
  shows that context-specific factors (i.e. poor infrastructure and lack of government initiatives) are negatively
  related to the adoption decision. Implications and limitations are discussed, and recommendations for future
  research are proposed.

   For this study, after gathering the data we ran a principal
component analysis which showed that the main contextual
factors are Political issues, Lack of government initiatives,
Poor infrastructure. This will be more elaborately explained
in the methodology section and result section later in the
study.
   Thus, it is clear that Lebanese SMEs are delayed in apply-
ing innovation and technology to their businesses. However,
the successful implementation of cloud computing in these
developing countries necessitates an organizational change,
a step that is requires time and new investments, especially
in a turbulent economy with unstable political conditions like
Lebanon. As a matter of fact, unstable political situation in
Lebanon, the wars, and the lack of a sense of security, do not
help in the future planning to adopt this technology. With this

conceptual model for cloud computing adoption in a MENA
country like Lebanon. Consequently, the following hypothe-
ses could be postulated:
 H14: Political issues and instability negatively impact
         cloud computing adoption.
 H15: Lack of government initiatives negatively impacts
         cloud computing adoption.
 H16: Poor infrastructure negatively impacts cloud comput-
