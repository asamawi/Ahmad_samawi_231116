Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this study is to determine the signiﬁcant factors affecting the adoption of Cloud
of Things (CoT) by Indian small and medium-sized enterprises, using exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor
analysis.
Design/methodology/approach – Signiﬁcant factors that impact CoT implementation were
identiﬁed through a detailed literature survey. A conceptual framework and hypotheses were proposed
for linking the signiﬁcant factors so identiﬁed, namely, cost saving, relative advantage, sharing and
collaboration, reliability, security and privacy, technical issues and adoption intention. The data were
collected from 270 Indian SMEs using an online survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used
to test the proposed model.
Findings – It was observed that factors such as “sharing and collaboration”, “cost saving” and “relative
advantage” had a positive inﬂuence on CoT adoption. Findings of the study also supported the hypothesis
that “security and privacy” were the prime concerns for CoT adoption.
Research limitations/implications – Sample coverage across different geographical areas with
qualitative data can be helpful. The SEM methodology is only capable of verifying linear relationships; to
counter this, a hybrid approach with tools such as artiﬁcial neural network and multiple linear regression can
be used.

       1. Introduction
       Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are large in number and include various
       essential aspects of the manufacturing sector (Ivers et al., 2016). They play a critical role in
       improving the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which helps in releasing employment
       pressure and getting closer to the optimised structure of the economy (Hallam et al., 2018). It
       may be noted that most of the SMEs lack in research and development, operations
       management and advanced technical capabilities. This highlights the need for quality
       research on behalf of the SMEs, exploring current technological developments (Müller et al.,
       2018).
          Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing are the essential technologies of the 21st
       century. In 2016, the Deutsche Telecom of Germany coined the term Cloud of Things (CoT),
       innovatively integrating cloud computing and IoT (Roopaei et al., 2017). Despite their
       separate evolutionary paths, IoT and cloud computing can assist each other in providing
       multiple mutual beneﬁts (Botta et al., 2016). The data from different IoT sensors can be
       published on cloud (with due permissions from the owners), thereby becoming accessible to
       many users simultaneously (Perera et al., 2014). It may be noted that CoT implementation
       makes the system more reliable, allowing resources to get accessed and used from
       everywhere. It also helps ensure that smart things/objects can be placed anywhere (Botta
       et al., 2016). As CoT service provides unlimited storage and processing capabilities and
       universal access to resources, its implementation across SMEs is considered beneﬁcial for
       the growth of the industry (Farahzadi et al., 2018). Its implementation results in improved
       productivity and enables SMEs to become location-independent (Gunashekar et al., 2016).
       Further, CoT implementation improves transparency within the organisation (Grifﬁths,
       2016). Also, it allows the quick ﬂow of information within the supply chain, which cements
       the supplier-customer relationship (Doherty et al., 2015).
          A little consideration will show that the SMEs of developing countries lack sufﬁcient
       awareness about the virtues of CoT, and the high initial investment is a prime concern for its
       adoption. Furthermore, very few research articles directly address the challenges faced by
       the SMEs for CoT adoption in developing countries like India. With this motivation, this
       study aims to address the following research questions and address the research objectives
       mentioned below:
          RQ1. Which factors inﬂuence CoT adoption in the Indian SMEs?
          RQ2. What is the inﬂuence of each factor on the adoption intention of CoT?
          RO1. To identify the factors inﬂuencing CoT adoption in SMEs.
          RO2. To establish the relationship between each factor and CoT adoption intention.
The rest of this paper has been organised as follows: to address the research questions and            Factors
attain the objectives mentioned above a detailed literature review has been carried out in         aﬀecting the
Section 2 to identify the factors and sub-factors that inﬂuence the adoption of CoT. In
Section 3, the conceptual model has been explained, and the research hypotheses have been
                                                                                                    adoption of
formulated. Section 4 details the research methodology, whereas in Section 5, the empirical     cloud of things
results have been elaborated. A discussion on the results and conclusion of the study has
been covered in Section 6.

2. Literature review
The literature survey section has been categorised into four sections, namely, Cloud
computing adoption, IoT adoption, CoT adoption and research gaps.

2.1 Cloud computing adoption
Various authors have discussed the adoption of cloud computing in the SMEs of developed,
developing and underdeveloped countries. Some of the publications are briefed below:
   Alshamaila et al. (2013) studied the SMEs of Northeast England and proposed signiﬁcant
drivers for cloud adoption, namely top management support, market scope, relative
advantage, external computing support, and prior experience. To determine cloud service
implementation behaviour across enterprises of Taiwan, Hsu and Lin (2016) used the
Technology–Organisation–Environment (TOE) framework. The results of the study
showed that technological factors (security and relative advantage), organisational factors
(ﬁnancial cost and complacency from existing IS) and environmental factors (competitive
pressure) had a positive inﬂuence on cloud service adoption. Raut et al. (2017) examined the
factors that inﬂuence the adoption of CC in the MSMEs using an interpretive structural
modelling approach, and the factor “previous technological experience” was found to be the
most signiﬁcant.
   Yigitbasioglu (2015) analysed the role of top management support and institutional
pressures on CC adoption intention using the partial least squares technique. It was
concluded that coercive and mimetic pressures affected top management’s belief to adopt CC
solutions. Narwane et al. (2019) detailed the issues related to cloud manufacturing and
focused on future research directions. Raut et al. (2018a) analysed the factors affecting CC
adoption in the quantitative and qualitative environment. Gangwar et al. (2015) identiﬁed
top management commitment, organisational readiness, compatibility, relative advantage,
complexity, and training and education as signiﬁcant variables for inﬂuencing cloud
adoption for Indian SMEs. In an exploratory study, Doherty et al. (2015) surveyed 1,500
SMEs of Ireland and concluded that “cost-beneﬁt” was a signiﬁcant driver, while the
continuous availability of services was a signiﬁcant concern for cloud adoption. Kumar et al.
(2017) studied Indian SMEs and concluded that ﬂexibility, scalability, easy deployment and
cost advantage had a positive inﬂuence on cloud adoption; poor internet connectivity,
security concern, vendor lock-in and loss of control were the signiﬁcant barriers.

2.2 Internet of Things adoption
This part of the manuscript focuses on the studies related to IoT adoption. A study
addressing Chilean SMEs was conducted by Grandon et al. (2018), which demonstrated that
facilitating conditions and social inﬂuence were the main determinants of IoT adoption. A
study conducted by Luthra et al. (2018) determined critical challenges to IoT adoption,
namely, lack of talent, lack of standardisation, security and privacy issues, poor internet
connectivity, costing issues and more extended payback period. Grifﬁths (2016) identiﬁed
improved safety and transparency, cost reduction, economic growth, and new business
JSIT   opportunities as primary drivers; on the other hand, privacy and security and integration
21,4   challenges were the barriers against IoT adoption across SMEs of UK. A study conducted
       by Tu (2018) across various industries of Taiwan revealed that perceived cost, perceived
       beneﬁts, external pressure and trust of technology were the critical factors inﬂuencing the
       adoption of IoT in the logistics and supply chain. Gao and Bai (2014) identiﬁed that
       perceived enjoyment, social inﬂuence, ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived
400    behavioural control were the signiﬁcant determinants of IoT users in a northern China city.

       2.3 Cloud of Things adoption
       The CoT paradigm has an impact on services like smart grid, smart logistics, smart cities,
       smart mobility, smart home, and smart metering (Botta et al., 2016; Díaz et al., 2016).
       However, CoT for manufacturing has not been explored much in the past studies. Some
       research articles focusing on CoT are discussed below:
          Yan et al. (2014) proposed a CoT framework for the supply chain management (SCM) that
       integrates supplier, warehouse, logistics, and client. The prototype implementation showed
       that virtualisation of resources helped in better resource management, service monitoring,
       and tracking. Ai et al. (2018) studied the factors affecting CoT adoption for computing,
       mobile edge computing, and cloudlets. Stergiou et al. (2018) surveyed security issues and
       beneﬁts of CoT. Also, the contribution of CC to IoT was detailed. Díaz et al. (2016)
       highlighted the open issues and challenges in the integration of CC and IoT. In healthcare
       systems, Thota et al. (2018) focused on the centralised fog computing security platform for
       CC and IoT and concluded that CoT applications provide secure and seamless access to
       health data. In the cloud manufacturing (CM) domain, Tao et al. (2014) studied the IoT-based
       intelligent perception towards CM. Also, the manufacturing resources and services were
       classiﬁed, and their relationships were discussed.
          To understand CoT adoption in Indian SMEs, Narwane et al. (2019) considered factors
       such as trust, IT security risk, ease of use and social inﬂuence. The results showed that
       social inﬂuence, ease of use and trust were positively related to adoption. Mitalaa et al. (2016)
       used multiple theoretical perspectives to understand CoT adoption in India. Constructs
       considered for the study were the attitude toward adoption, behavioural control, ease of use,
       usefulness, subjective norms, and intention. Exploratory analysis showed that except
       behavioural control, all other constructs inﬂuenced CoT adoption. To measure trust
       reputation in CoT group formation, Fortino et al. (2018) proposed a trust metric and agent
       grouping algorithm. The study identiﬁed helpfulness, reliability and local reputation as
       prominent factors.
          Through literature review, several factors that inﬂuence cloud and IoT adoption were
       shortlisted. Common factors inﬂuencing the adoption of both IoT and cloud technology,
       along with their sub-factors, were grouped into six constructs, i.e. Relative advantage,
       Reliability, Sharing and collaboration, Cost saving, Privacy concerns and Technical issues
       (Table I).

       2.4 Research gaps
       Most of the studies enlisted above have addressed adoption factors either for cloud
       computing or IoT by conducting survey-based research across SMEs. Literature survey
       shows that several articles focused on the adoption of CC (Alshamaila et al., 2013; Doherty
       et al., 2015; Gangwar et al., 2015; Hsu and Lin, 2016; Kumar et al., 2017; Narwane et al., 2019;
       Raut et al., 2017; Raut et al., 2018a; Yigitbasioglu, 2015) and IoT (Gao and Bai, 2014; Grandon
       et al., 2018; Grifﬁths, 2016; Hsu and Lin, 2018; Luthra et al., 2018; Tu, 2018) separately, but
       only few papers have discussed the adoption of CoT, i.e. a combination of both (Ai et al., 2018;

21,4               Stergiou et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2014; Thota et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2014). A little consideration
                   will show that none of the past studies has focused on CoT adoption in the Indian SMEs
                   context by employing a quantitative approach such as EFA-CFA- structural equation
                   modelling (SEM). Hence, the critical goal of the present research is to identify and analyse the
                   factors that inﬂuence the adoption intention of CoT in the Indian SMEs context by employing
406                the EFA-CFA-SEM approach. This is the novelty of the present research framework.
                   Undoubtedly, the factors inﬂuencing CoT adoption for developing countries will be different
                   from those of the developed countries. Large-scale manufacturing companies in India have
                   started to adopt the latest trends in Industry 4.0/smart manufacturing. The government of
                   India is actively promoting the “Make in India” initiative. Thus, SMEs who are major
                   suppliers to these large manufacturers must adopt CoT to sustain in this rapidly changing
                   scenario. This observation is the driving motivation for this study.

                   3. Conceptual model and hypotheses development
                   3.1 Conceptual model
                   A conceptual model is considered as a structure of interrelated constructs in an organised
                   form. It represents the relationship between observed variables and the constructs. A
                   proposed conceptual framework for this study is shown in Figure 1.

                   3.2 Pilot study
                   Initially, logical grouping was done as per the technical speciﬁcations of the factors. In order
                   to conﬁrm the grouping of these variables, a pilot study across 30 SMEs was conducted.
                   Based on the results of the pilot study, ﬁnal constructs and their indicator variables were

reduced to 22. Table II shows the sub-factors retained for the actual survey and the

4.1 Sample characteristics
Total 243 responses were received from employees as well as decision-makers of the 270
SMEs, out of which 124 were valid. Industry-wise distribution of respondents is as follows:
manufacturing industry (45 per cent), business sector (27 per cent), IT (13 per cent),
education sector (2 per cent) and others (13 per cent). Distribution of respondents as per their
knowledge about cloud computing, IoT and CoT technology is as follows: 51 per cent of the
respondents were aware of CoT technology, i.e. integration of cloud computing and IoT, 22
per cent of the respondents were aware of cloud computing and/or IoT technology, and 27
per cent of the respondents were not aware of cloud computing, IoT and CoT technology.
Hence, 124 responses (51 per cent), which belong to the CoT technology category were
considered as valid and were analysed further.

4.2 Exploratory factor analysis
Factor analysis helps analyse the structure of interrelationships among a large number of
variables by deﬁning a set of variables that are highly correlated, known as factors. Also, it
helps reduce the data (Hair et al., 2010). The Bartlett’s test of sphericity is used to check the
appropriateness of factor analysis. Another useful indicator is KMO, i.e. Kaiser–Meyer–
Olkin to measure sampling adequacy. Its values range from 0 to 1. KMO values of more than
0.5 are acceptable (Hair et al., 2010).

4.3 Conﬁrmatory factor analysis
CFA checks the stability of the scale and determines the model ﬁt, validity and reliability of the
proposed conceptual model. SEM is popularly used to execute CFA. SEM explains how well the
conceptual model determines observed correlations among the measured variables (Malhotra,
2010; Pawaskar et al.,2018). Reliability is considered as the degree to which the measurement
scale produces consistent outputs. Composite reliability (CR) is the ratio of total true score
variance identiﬁed about the total score variance. Value of CR ranges from 0 to 1, where 0
indicates no consistency in measuring outputs while 1 indicates perfect consistency. Though
CR above 0.7 is desirable, values between 0.6-0.7 are also acceptable (Hair et al., 2010).
    Validity signiﬁes how effectively a speciﬁc property can be measured. Construct validity
has two components, i.e. convergent validity and discriminant validity (Malhotra, 2010). The
estimate to test convergent validity is AVE (average variance extracted). AVE can be
deﬁned as variance in observed or indicator variables that is explained by the latent
construct. Values of AVE  0.5 show signiﬁcant convergent validity. Discriminant validity
indicates that each indicator measures only one construct. For discriminant validity, the
square root of AVE must be larger than the correlation coefﬁcients (Hair et al., 2010).

5. Empirical results
In statistical analysis, EFA was performed using the IBM SPSS statistic V20, and for CFA
and SEM, AMOS V22.0 was used. In order to test the research hypotheses, authors

21,4                Principal component analysis and varimax rotation method were used to obtain constructs.
                    Variables that showed loading less than 0.5 were suppressed. The rotated factor matrix is
                    shown in Table III.
                       It was found that KMO = 0.851 > 0.5 and thus, acceptable. Bartlett’s test of sphericity
                    signiﬁcance value was 0.00, which is below 0.05 and hence, signiﬁcant at 95 per cent

                    5.2 Conﬁrmatory factor analysis
                    5.2.1 Discriminant validity. Discriminant validity deﬁnes that each indicator variable
                    measures only for one construct, i.e. a given construct is distinct from the others (Hair et al.,
                    2010). Table IV shows the obtained results of CR and AVE.
                        The Fornell–Larcker criterion is usually employed to assess the discriminant validity of
                    latent constructs, which demands that the square root of AVE must be more signiﬁcant than
                    correlation coefﬁcients (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Table V demonstrates that almost all
                    latent constructs met the required criteria.
                        However, the Fornell–Larcker criterion is inadequate in detecting the absence of
                    discriminant validity in variance-based SEM. Henseler et al. (2015) proposed the

by Hair et al. (2017) that the HTMT value should be less than 0.9 for conceptually
similar constructs and 0.85 for conceptually different constructs. Results of a study by

   In this study, Smart PLS 3 software was used for estimating the HTMT ratio among the
constructs. HTMT values among all the constructs were found to be less than 1 and also less
than 0.85 (Table VI). Thus, discriminant validity for the proposed model is achieved.

well as which proposed model has the most superior ﬁt. The observed value of GFI in
this study was 0.985, which was above 0.9 and thus, acceptable (Hair et al., 2010).
RMSEA (Root mean square error of approximation) is considered as the badness of ﬁt
index. It estimates the residual, or in other words, square root of the mean of squared
residual. Its value was ascertained to be 0.036, which is less than 0.08 and thus,
acceptable. Figure 2 shows the path diagram of CFA.

                        5.3 Hypothesis testing
                        In order to test the six research hypotheses, linear regression in SPSS was performed. Linear
                        regression is generally used for ascertaining a relationship between the constructs. In this
                        analysis, adoption intention was considered as a dependent variable, while the other
                        constructs were independent variables. Results of hypothesis testing are shown in
                        Table VII.
                            The analysis shows that out of six hypotheses, four were supported while two were not.
                        The hypotheses that were not supported dealt with the negative relationship between
                        technical issues and CoT adoption (0.615), and a positive relationship between reliability and
                        CoT adoption (0.539). It should be noted that few ﬁndings of the present study do not fall in
                        line with the past results, which may be attributed to differences in geographical region and
                        type of industries.

                        6. Discussion and conclusions
                        In the present investigation, six signiﬁcant factors that inﬂuence the adoption intention of
                        CoT in the Indian SMEs context have been identiﬁed through literature review and they
                        were analysed using the EFA-CFA-SEM methodology. The relationship between each factor
                        and the CoT adoption intention has been established along with the strength of each
                        relationship. Two research questions have been addressed and formulated research
                        objectives have been attained. It may be noted that CoT allows resources to get accessed and
                        used from anywhere. Also, it enables smart things/objects to be placed anywhere. The
                        implementation of CoT makes the system more reliable and improves transparency within
                        the organization. This study has presented the signiﬁcance of CoT as a novel technology for
                        SMEs in the context of a developing country like India. The large-scale manufacturing ﬁrms
                        of India have already started using these advanced technologies and expect the SMEs to
                        follow suit in due course of time.
                            It is apparent from this study that cost saving, relative advantage and sharing and
                        collaboration are signiﬁcant drivers for CoT adoption. Importantly, security and privacy is a
                        signiﬁcant concern for CoT adoption across Indian SMEs. It was found that cost saving is
                        an important criterion for CoT adoption. This is because the resources can be allocated and
                        de-allocated on demand, and there can be considerable cost savings through resource de-
                        allocation during low service demands (Doherty et al., 2015). Also, sensing as a service
                        provides access to data at a reduced cost (Perera et al., 2014). The positive inﬂuence of
                        relative advantage on the adoption of CoT has also been explored in previous studies. The

CoT service provides unlimited storage and processing capabilities and ubiquitous access to
resources. The implementation of CoT is signiﬁcantly beneﬁcial to the SMEs as it helps to
improve productivity and propels SMEs towards location independence (Farahzadi et al.,
2018; Gunashekar et al., 2016).
   Data security has been identiﬁed as an issue for both cloud and IoT. As data centres are
positioned away from the SME location, customer needs to depend on service providers for
the physical safety of data and resources (Doherty et al., 2015). Due to a lack of trust among
service providers, SMEs fear to handover their sensitive data. Also, technical issues such as
delay in data transfer, network and connectivity issue, lack of common standards, vendor
lock-in, difﬁculty in understanding and reduced energy efﬁciency detract the CoT adoption
intention of SMEs. Due to the delay in data transfer, real-time data tracking becomes

                     difﬁcult. It is a signiﬁcant concern for time-critical applications used in the ﬁnancial market
                     and international trading (Doherty et al., 2015). However, in the present investigation, the
                     negative relationship between technical issues and CoT adoption was not supported. This
                     indicates that technical issues no longer act as barriers in the practical adoption CoT and
                     this factor needs to be analysed in detail in the further research activities.
                         The paper will be useful for academic researchers as well as professionals in
                     understanding the issues pertaining to CoT adoption. The identiﬁed factors and sub-factors
                     will aid researchers in pinpointing issues and obtaining further directions regarding CoT
                     adoption for SMEs. Researchers working in the case domain may explore the same problem
                     in different countries by employing different methodologies. Also, a comparative study may
                     be carried out across different economies and various sectors to understand their inclination
                     towards the adoption of CoT. This study guides the managers in understanding the factors
                     that affect CoT adoption in the context of Indian SMEs and their inﬂuence on the adoption
                     decision. In addition, this investigation intends to help the policymakers of SMEs to
                     formulate strategies and recommendations for the effective adoption of CoT.
                         Further, the service providers may use ﬁndings of this study for improved and more
                     effective marketing by showcasing their strengths. Also, they can identify their weaknesses
                     and improve upon them to stay competitive in the highly volatile market scenario. They need
                     to upgrade themselves in order to provide more ﬂexible and robust services to increase the CoT
                     adoption rate among the SMEs. In addition, the service provider should offer low-cost solutions
                     without compromising on security and privacy concerns. Additionally, government and local
                     regulatory authorities need to encourage SMEs by spreading awareness regarding the beneﬁts
                     of the CoT and by offering incentives to the adopting ﬁrms.
                         The main limitation of this study is that the ﬁndings cannot be applied directly to developed
                     economies as the responses received for developing the SEM model were obtained from the
                     Indian SMEs, i.e. from the viewpoint of developing economies. However, this model
                     may be applicable to the other economies after carrying out minor modiﬁcations.
Further, the SEM methodology employed in this study is only capable of verifying                                      Factors
linear relationships; to counter this a hybrid approach with tools such as artiﬁcial                              aﬀecting the
neural network and multiple linear regression can be used to further understand the
inﬂuence of factors on CoT adoption. Since CoT is an emerging technology and with
                                                                                                                   adoption of
more beneﬁts, new services and business opportunities, its adoption on a large scale is                        cloud of things
expected shortly among the SMEs. By replicating this survey research in other
geographical areas, with higher sample coverage and using qualitative and
quantitative research methods, more appropriate and universal results can be obtained.                                   415
By considering the results of this study, which include signiﬁcant factors affecting
adoption of CoT, one can build a more robust CoT platform for the better penetration of
CoT in the Indian industries.
