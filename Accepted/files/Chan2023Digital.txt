                 Abstract. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of digital technologies in enhancing the
                 resilience of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in developing countries, amidst
                 natural disasters. Frequent earthquakes in Aceh, Indonesia, not only pose a medical emergency but also
                 disrupt businesses, demanding adaptability and resilience. SMEs, constrained by limited resources, face
                 heightened vulnerability. Drawing from a survey of 30 SME owners in Indonesia, this research reveals the
                 pivotal role played by digital technology in enabling SMEs to withstand disasters, strengthen their
                 operations, and ensure their continuity. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, which combines
                 qualitative and quantitative research methods. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of
                 the research problem by gathering different types of data. The qualitative data from interviews are analyzed
                 using thematic analysis. This involves identifying recurring themes and patterns related to digital technology
                 adoption and SME resilience.The findings of the study address a significant gap in existing literature,
                 shedding light on the specific challenges faced by SMEs in developing countries and their strategies for
                 digital transformation. From this preliminary study, two practical recommendations emerge. Firstly, SMEs
                 are encouraged to invest in the adoption and integration of digital technology across various facets of their
                 operations. This entails leveraging digital communication channels, harnessing cloud computing and e-
                 commerce platforms, utilizing data analytics for informed decision-making, and exploring automation where
                 applicable. These digital tools empower SMEs to enhance operational efficiency, elevate customer
                 engagement, and adapt to evolving market dynamics. Secondly, the responsibility lies with tech developers
                 and policymakers to support SMEs on their digital transformation journey. Tech developers can make
                 significant contributions by designing user-friendly and cost-effective digital solutions tailored to the unique
                 needs of SMEs in developing countries. Policymakers can foster an enabling environment by enacting
                 supportive policies, providing essential financial incentives, and advocating partnerships between SMEs and
                 technology providers. These concerted efforts pave the way for SMEs to thrive amidst challenges and
                 contribute to heir sustained growth and prosperity.
