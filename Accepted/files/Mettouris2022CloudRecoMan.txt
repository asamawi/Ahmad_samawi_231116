    Research projects in data management domain have tended to
focus on the improved presentation and categorisation of data in
Clouds to aid integration with Cloud services. A good example
of such work can be seen in the cloudTM project [8]. Here the
project is focused on creating a data centric middleware in order to
aid better identification of data and its requirements to aid better
efficiency and fault tolerance in the Cloud.
    Modelling projects are focusing on the use of models to support
specific challenges such as the migration of legacy systems to the
Cloud. In the Artist project, models are used to describe and wrap
legacy systems to aid migration [9]. Other projects are looking to
existing standards to aid the model-based management of Clouds,
such as the Mosaic Cloud project that has embraced ontologies as
central to their modelling solution [10]. PaaSage [11] takes a step
back from providing a purely technical interface to the PaaSage ap-
plication developer user and encourages the user to model his/her
requirements before technical integration takes place. User defined
application models expressed in CAMEL allow for a richer expres-
sion of application and business application end-user requirements
translating down to how the Cloud is managed in terms of resource
usage. Advancing research in MODAClouds and projects such as
MOSAIC [10] inform work in PaaSage which groups domain spe-
cific standards in models at all stages of application use in the Cloud.                    Figure 1: CloudRecoMan platform architecture.
