\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core Trend:} SME digital transformation in developing regions -> Cloud adoption.
    \item \textbf{Drivers:} Cost efficiency, flexibility, lack of on-prem infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{New Risk:} Cyber exposure (Data breaches, service interruption).
    \item \textbf{Root Cause:} Poor configuration, weak governance, lack of expertise.
    \item \textbf{Chapter Focus:} Background, Motivation, Context, Study Objectives.
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adoption:} Cloud as "Equalizer" for SMEs (scale without CapEx).
    \item \textbf{Reality:} Security often secondary to speed of deployment.
    \item \textbf{Common Errors:} Default settings, weak access control, ad-hoc practices.
    \item \textbf{Framework Mismatch:} International standards identify *what* to do, but not *how* to do it with limited resources.
    \item \textbf{Gap:} Lack of deployment-oriented models for SMEs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Context of the Study}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Setting:} Socioeconomic/Regulatory context of developing regions (Lebanon, Egypt, etc.).
    \item \textbf{Constraints:} Uneven regulation, limited cyber preparedness, skills gap.
    \item \textbf{Example (Lebanon):} Legal frameworks exist but organizational readiness is low.
    \item \textbf{Barriers:} Infrastructure, Cost, Technical Training.
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Technical solutions must align with organizational capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Problem}

\textbf{Misalignment:} Security guidance vs. SME reality (Limited expertise, budget, informal governance).

\textbf{Deficiency:} Literature focuses on "Adoption Drivers" or "High-Level Theory", lacking operational guidance.

\textbf{Core Question:}
\textit{How can SMEs in developing regions operationalize secure cloud deployment and management practices within the constraints identified in existing empirical research?}

\section{Objectives of the Study}

\textbf{Goal:} Develop and assess a deployment-oriented \textit{Secure Cloud Deployment Framework (SCDF)}.

\textbf{Specific Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{examine} existing frameworks for SME-applicable controls.
    \item \textbf{Design} a modular, open-source-based deployment framework.
    \item \textbf{Assess} feasibility via simulation and expert review.
\end{enumerate}
